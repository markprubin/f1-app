Formula One Data App

This is a simple Ruby script using the Ergast Developer API, which is an experimental web service providing historical record of motor racing data for non-commericial purposes. It provides data for the Formula One Series, starting from the world championships in 1950 to the present day.


Currently, this script only spits out data for the 2022 season, which includes Grand Prix locations, Top 3 results for each Grand Prix, the Driver Standings and Constructor Standings. It utilizes a few gems to make it more visually appealing.


To run in the terminal, type in ./f1-app.rb and follow the prompts.
