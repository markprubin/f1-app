# Formula One Data App

- This is a simple Ruby script using the Ergast Developer API, which is an experimental web service providing historical record of motor racing data for non-commericial purposes. It provides data for the Formula One Series, starting from the world championships in 1950 to the present day.

- Currently, this script only displays data for the 2022 season, which includes Grand Prix locations, Top 3 results for each Grand Prix, the Driver Standings and Constructor Standings. It also displays the champion for each season in Formula One.
- It utilizes a few gems to make it more visually appealing.
